    "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will cover the basic of Python language and features of python. The tutorial is created with Jupyter Notebook a web application that allow us to share documents including live python code, however this tutorial can be followed using your python intrepreter. We will also assume you have basic programming skill so we will skip a lot of basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use python 3.6 for this tutorial which you can download and install from https://www.python.org/. After installing python you can open you command line/bash and type \"__python --v__\" to check your installed python version. You can also start your python intrepreter with typing \"python\" in your command line and press enter."
